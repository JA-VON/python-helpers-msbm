Disaster,"A serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources. ","Comment: Disasters are often described as a result of the combination of: the exposure to a hazard; the conditions of vulnerability that are present; and insufficient capacity or measures to reduce or cope with the potential negative consequences. Disaster impacts may include loss of life, injury, disease and other negative effects on human physical, mental and social well-being, together with damage to property, destruction of assets, loss of services, social and economic disruption and environmental degradation.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Disaster Recovery Plan,"A disaster recovery plan (DRP) - sometimes referred to as a business continuity plan (BCP) or business process contingency plan (BPCP) - describes how an organization is to deal with potential disasters. Just as a disaster is an event that makes the continuation of normal functions impossible, a disaster recovery plan consists of the precautions taken so that the effects of a disaster will be minimized and the organization will be able to either maintain or quickly resume mission-critical functions. Typically, disaster recovery planning involves an analysis of business processes and continuity needs; it may also include a significant focus on disaster prevention.",,2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Disaster risk,"The potential disaster losses, in lives, health status, livelihoods, assets and services, which could occur to a particular community or a society over some specified future time period. ","Comment: The definition of disaster risk reflects the concept of disasters as the outcome of continuously present conditions of risk. Disaster risk comprises different types of potential losses which are often difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, with knowledge of the prevailing hazards and the patterns of population and socio-economic development, disaster risks can be assessed and mapped, in broad terms at least.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Disaster risk management,"The systematic process of using administrative directives, organizations, and operational skills and capacities to implement strategies, policies and improved coping capacities in order to lessen the adverse impacts of hazards and the possibility of disaster. ","Comment: This term is an extension of the more general term “risk management” to address the specific issue of disaster risks.

Extensive risk,"The widespread risk associated with the exposure of dispersed populations to repeated or persistent hazard conditions of low or moderate intensity, often of a highly localized nature, which can lead to debilitating cumulative disaster impacts. ","Comment: Extensive risk is mainly a characteristic of rural areas and urban margins where communities are exposed to, and vulnerable to, recurring localised floods, landslides storms or drought. Extensive risk is often associated with poverty, urbanization and environmental degradation. See also “Intensive risk”.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Forecast,Definite statement or statistical estimate of the likely occurrence of a future event or conditions for a specific area. ,"Comment: In meteorology a forecast refers to a future condition, whereas a warning refers to a potentially dangerous future condition.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Geological hazard,"Geological process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage. ","Comment: Geological hazards include internal earth processes, such as earthquakes, volcanic activity and emissions, and related geophysical processes such as mass movements, landslides, rockslides, surface collapses, and debris or mud flows. Hydrometeorological factors are important contributors to some of these processes. Tsunamis are difficult to categorize; although they are triggered by undersea earthquakes and other geological events, they are essentially an oceanic process that is manifested as a coastal water-related hazard.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Greenhouse gases,"Gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation of thermal infrared radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface, the atmosphere itself, and by clouds. ","Comment: This is the definition of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The main greenhouse gases (GHG) are water vapour, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane and ozone.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Hazard,"A dangerous phenomenon, substance, human activity or condition that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage. ","Comment: The hazards of concern to disaster risk reduction as stated in footnote 3 of the Hyogo Framework are “… hazards of natural origin and related environmental and technological hazards and risks.” Such hazards arise from a variety of geological, meteorological, hydrological, oceanic, biological, and technological sources, sometimes acting in combination. In technical settings, hazards are described quantitatively by the likely frequency of occurrence of different intensities for different areas, as determined from historical data or scientific analysis. See other hazard-related terms in the Terminology: Biological hazard; Geological hazard; Hydrometeorological hazard; Natural hazard; Socio-natural hazard; Technological hazard.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Hydrometeorological hazard,"Process or phenomenon of atmospheric, hydrological or oceanographic nature that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage. ","Comment: Hydrometeorological hazards include tropical cyclones (also known as typhoons and hurricanes), thunderstorms, hailstorms, tornados, blizzards, heavy snowfall, avalanches, coastal storm surges, floods including flash floods, drought, heatwaves and cold spells. Hydrometeorological conditions also can be a factor in other hazards such as landslides, wildland fires, locust plagues, epidemics, and in the transport and dispersal of toxic substances and volcanic eruption material",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Intensive risk,"The risk associated with the exposure of large concentrations of people and economic activities to intense hazard events, which can lead to potentially catastrophic disaster impacts involving high mortality and asset loss. ","Comment: Intensive risk is mainly a characteristic of large cities or densely populated areas that are not only exposed to intense hazards such as strong earthquakes, active volcanoes, heavy floods, tsunamis, or major storms but also have high levels of vulnerability to these hazards. See also “Extensive risk"".",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Land-use planning,"The process undertaken by public authorities to identify, evaluate and decide on different options for the use of land, including consideration of long term economic, social and environmental objectives and the implications for different communities and interest groups, and the subsequent formulation and promulgation of plans that describe the permitted or acceptable uses. ","Comment: Land-use planning is an important contributor to sustainable development. It involves studies and mapping; analysis of economic, environmental and hazard data; formulation of alternative land-use decisions; and design of long-range plans for different geographical and administrative scales. Land-use planning can help to mitigate disasters and reduce risks by discouraging settlements and construction of key installations in hazard-prone areas, including consideration of service routes for transport, power, water, sewage and other critical facilities.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Livelihood,"The means by which an individual or household obtains assets for survival and self-development. Livelihood assets are the tools (skills, objects, rights, knowledge, social capital) applied to enacting the livelihood.",,2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Mitigation,The lessening or limitation of the adverse impacts of hazards and related disasters. ,"Comment: The adverse impacts of hazards often cannot be prevented fully, but their scale or severity can be substantially lessened by various strategies and actions. Mitigation measures encompass engineering techniques and hazard-resistant construction as well as improved environmental policies and public awareness. It should be noted that in climate change policy, “mitigation” is defined differently, being the term used for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions that are the source of climate change.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction,"A generic term for national mechanisms for coordination and policy guidance on disaster risk reduction that are multi-sectoral and inter-disciplinary in nature, with public, private and civil society participation involving all concerned entities within a country. ","Comment: This definition is derived from footnote 10 of the Hyogo Framework. Disaster risk reduction requires the knowledge, capacities and inputs of a wide range of sectors and organisations, including United Nations agencies present at the national level, as appropriate. Most sectors are affected directly or indirectly by disasters and many have specific responsibilities that impinge upon disaster risks. National platforms provide a means to enhance national action to reduce disaster risks, and they represent the national mechanism for the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Natural hazard,"Natural process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage. ","Comment: Natural hazards are a sub-set of all hazards. The term is used to describe actual hazard events as well as the latent hazard conditions that may give rise to future events. Natural hazard events can be characterized by their magnitude or intensity, speed of onset, duration, and area of extent. For example, earthquakes have short durations and usually affect a relatively small region, whereas droughts are slow to develop and fade away and often affect large regions. In some cases hazards may be coupled, as in the flood caused by a hurricane or the tsunami that is created by an earthquake.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Preparedness,"The knowledge and capacities developed by governments, professional response and recovery organizations, communities and individuals to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from, the impacts of likely, imminent or current hazard events or conditions. ","Comment: Preparedness action is carried out within the context of disaster risk management and aims to build the capacities needed to efficiently manage all types of emergencies and achieve orderly transitions from response through to sustained recovery. Preparedness is based on a sound analysis of disaster risks and good linkages with early warning systems, and includes such activities as contingency planning, stockpiling of equipment and supplies, the development of arrangements for coordination, evacuation and public information, and associated training and field exercises. These must be supported by formal institutional, legal and budgetary capacities. The related term “readiness” describes the ability to quickly and appropriately respond when required.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Prevention,The outright avoidance of adverse impacts of hazards and related disasters. ,"Comment: Prevention (i.e. disaster prevention) expresses the concept and intention to completely avoid potential adverse impacts through action taken in advance. Examples include dams or embankments that eliminate flood risks, land-use regulations that do not permit any settlement in high risk zones, and seismic engineering designs that ensure the survival and function of a critical building in any likely earthquake. Very often the complete avoidance of losses is not feasible and the task transforms to that of mitigation. Partly for this reason, the terms prevention and mitigation are sometimes used interchangeably in casual use.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Prospective disaster risk management,Management activities that address and seek to avoid the development of new or increased disaster risks. ,"Comment: This concept focuses on addressing risks that may develop in future if risk reduction policies are not put in place, rather than on the risks that are already present and which can be managed and reduced now. See also Corrective disaster risk management.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Public awareness,"The extent of common knowledge about disaster risks, the factors that lead to disasters and the actions that can be taken individually and collectively to reduce exposure and vulnerability to hazards. ","Comment: Public awareness is a key factor in effective disaster risk reduction. Its development is pursued, for example, through the development and dissemination of information through media and educational channels, the establishment of information centres, networks, and community or participation actions, and advocacy by senior public officials and community leaders.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Recovery,"The restoration, and improvement where appropriate, of facilities, livelihoods and living conditions of disaster-affected communities, including efforts to reduce disaster risk factors. ","Comment: The recovery task of rehabilitation and reconstruction begins soon after the emergency phase has ended, and should be based on pre-existing strategies and policies that facilitate clear institutional responsibilities for recovery action and enable public participation. Recovery programmes, coupled with the heightened public awareness and engagement after a disaster, afford a valuable opportunity to develop and implement disaster risk reduction measures and to apply the “build back better” principle.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Residual risk,"The risk that remains in unmanaged form, even when effective disaster risk reduction measures are in place, and for which emergency response and recovery capacities must be maintained. ","Comment: The presence of residual risk implies a continuing need to develop and support effective capacities for emergency services, preparedness, response and recovery together with socio-economic policies such as safety nets and risk transfer mechanisms.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Resilience,"The ability of a system, community or society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate to and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner, including through the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions. ",Comment: Resilience means the ability to “resile from” or “spring back from” a shock. The resilience of a community in respect to potential hazard events is determined by the degree to which the community has the necessary resources and is capable of organizing itself both prior to and during times of need.,2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Response,"The provision of emergency services and public assistance during or immediately after a disaster in order to save lives, reduce health impacts, ensure public safety and meet the basic subsistence needs of the people affected. ","Comment: Disaster response is predominantly focused on immediate and short-term needs and is sometimes called “disaster relief”. The division between this response stage and the subsequent recovery stage is not clear-cut. Some response actions, such as the supply of temporary housing and water supplies, may extend well into the recovery stage.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Retrofitting,Reinforcement or upgrading of existing structures to become more resistant and resilient to the damaging effects of hazards. ,"Comment: Retrofitting requires consideration of the design and function of the structure, the stresses that the structure may be subject to from particular hazards or hazard scenarios, and the practicality and costs of different retrofitting options. Examples of retrofitting include adding bracing to stiffen walls, reinforcing pillars, adding steel ties between walls and roofs, installing shutters on windows, and improving the protection of important facilities and equipment.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Risk management,The systematic approach and practice of managing uncertainty to minimize potential harm and loss. ,"Comment: Risk management comprises risk assessment and analysis, and the implementation of strategies and specific actions to control, reduce and transfer risks. It is widely practiced by organizations to minimise risk in investment decisions and to address operational risks such as those of business disruption, production failure, environmental damage, social impacts and damage from fire and natural hazards. Risk management is a core issue for sectors such as water supply, energy and agriculture whose production is directly affected by extremes of weather and climate.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Risk transfer,"The process of formally or informally shifting the financial consequences of particular risks from one party to another whereby a household, community, enterprise or state authority will obtain resources from the other party after a disaster occurs, in exchange for ongoing or compensatory social or financial benefits provided to that other party. ","Comment: Insurance is a well-known form of risk transfer, where coverage of a risk is obtained from an insurer in exchange for ongoing premiums paid to the insurer. Risk transfer can occur informally within family and community networks where there are reciprocal expectations of mutual aid by means of gifts or credit, as well as formally where governments, insurers, multi-lateral banks and other large risk-bearing entities establish mechanisms to help cope with losses in major events. Such mechanisms include insurance and re-insurance contracts, catastrophe bonds, contingent credit facilities and reserve funds, where the costs are covered by premiums, investor contributions, interest rates and past savings, respectively.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Socio-natural hazard,"The phenomenon of increased occurrence of certain geophysical and hydrometeorological hazard events, such as landslides, flooding, land subsidence and drought, that arise from the interaction of natural hazards with overexploited or degraded land and environmental resources. ",Comment: This term is used for the circumstances where human activity is increasing the occurrence of certain hazards beyond their natural probabilities. Evidence points to a growing disaster burden from such hazards. Socio-natural hazards can be reduced and avoided through wise management of land and environmental resources.,2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Structural measures,"Structural measures: Any physical construction to reduce or avoid possible impacts of hazards, or application of engineering techniques to achieve hazard-resistance and resilience in structures or systems;","Comment: Common structural measures for disaster risk reduction include dams, flood levies, ocean wave barriers, earthquake-resistant construction, and evacuation shelters. Note that in civil and structural engineering, the term “structural” is used in a more restricted sense to mean just the load-bearing structure, with other parts such as wall cladding and interior fittings being termed non-structural.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Non-structural measures,"Non-structural measures: Any measure not involving physical construction that uses knowledge, practice or agreement to reduce risks and impacts, in particular through policies and laws, public awareness raising, training and education. ","Common non-structural measures include building codes, land use planning laws and their enforcement, research and assessment, information resources, and public awareness programmes. ",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Sustainable development,Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. ,"Comment: This definition coined by the 1987 Brundtland Commission is very succinct but it leaves unanswered many questions regarding the meaning of the word development and the social, economic and environmental processes involved. Disaster risk is associated with unsustainable elements of development such as environmental degradation, while conversely disaster risk reduction can contribute to the achievement of sustainable development, through reduced losses and improved development practices.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Technological hazards,"A hazard originating from technological or industrial conditions, including accidents, dangerous procedures, infrastructure failures or specific human activities, that may cause loss of life, injury, illness or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage. ","Comment: Examples of technological hazards include industrial pollution, nuclear radiation, toxic wastes, dam failures, transport accidents, factory explosions, fires, and chemical spills. Technological hazards also may arise directly as a result of the impacts of a natural hazard event.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,
Vulnerability,"The characteristics and circumstances of a community, system or asset that make it susceptible to the damaging effects of a hazard. ","Comment: There are many aspects of vulnerability, arising from various physical, social, economic, and environmental factors. Examples may include poor design and construction of buildings, inadequate protection of assets, lack of public information and awareness, limited official recognition of risks and preparedness measures, and disregard for wise environmental management. Vulnerability varies significantly within a community and over time. This definition identifies vulnerability as a characteristic of the element of interest (community, system or asset) which is independent of its exposure. However, in common use the word is often used more broadly to include the element’s exposure.",2009 UNISDR terminology on disaster risk reduction,

Landslide,"1-Geological phenomenon which includes a range of ground movement, such as rock falls, deep failure of slopes and shallow debris flows

2-A landslide is a mass movement of material, such as rock, earth or debris, down the slope of a hill or cliff. They can happen suddenly or move slowly over long periods of time. Landslides are classified by their type of movement. The four main types of movement are falls, topples, rotational slides, translational slides and flows. Landslides can be classified as just one of these movements or, more commonly, can be a mixture of several.",,Source 1: Business Continuity Planning (BCP): Sample Plan For Nonprofit Organizations Source 2: ,
Flows,"Flows are landslides that involve the movement of material down a slope in the form of a fluid. When material on a slope becomes saturated with water, making it much heavier, it may develop into a debris flow or mud flow.",,,
Debris Flow,"A debris flow is a moving mass of loose mud, sand, soil, rock, water and air that travels down a slope under the influence of gravity. To be considered a debris flow the moving material must be loose and capable of ""flow"", and, at least 50% of the material must be sand-size particles or larger.",,,
Mud Flow,A mud flow is composed of mud and water.,,,
Falls,"Falls are landslides that involve the collapse of material from a cliff or steep slope. Falls usually involve a mixture of free fall through the air, bouncing or rolling. A fall type landslide results in the collection of rock or debris near the base of a slope.",,,
Topples,"Topple failures involve the forward rotation and movement of a mass of rock, earth or debris out of a slope. This kind of slope failure generally occurs around an axis (or point) at or near the base of the block of rock",,,
Slides,"A slide type landslide is a down-slope movement of material that occurs along a distinctive surface of weakness such as a fault, joint or bedding plane.",,,
Rotational Slide,If the slip surface is curved the slide said to be rotational. The slip surface of a rotational landslide tends to be deep. Blocks of failed material can rotate as they fail and can at times be seen to tilt backwards towards the slope.,,,
Translational Slide,If the slip surface is straight then it is termed translational or planar. ,,,
Submarine Landslide," The sea bed can fail when physical conditions change, just as on land, creating an underwater landslide. These mass movements of vast amounts of sediment are called submarine landslides or just slides",,,

Stratovolcanoes,"Stratovolcanoes are majestic giants with steep sides and a symmetrical cone shape. They form from very thick, viscous, or sticky, lava that won't flow easily. The lava therefore builds up around the vent forming a volcano with steep sides – we call this a stratovolcano and it has a familar triangular shape",,,
Shield Volcano,"Where a volcano produces low viscosity, runny, lava it spreads far from the source forming a volcano with gentle slopes. This type is called a shield volcano.",,,
Fissure Vent Eruption,"As magma rises, it will find the easiest route to reach the surface. If it rises up through a long fracture, fountains of lava can form a ‘curtain of fire’ which we call a fissure vent eruption",,,
Spatter Cone Volcano,"When magma contains too much gas to form an effusive lava flow, but too little to form an explosive eruption, it erupts from the volcano as blobs of magma which fall close to the vent forming a low, steep-sided cone that we call a spatter cone.",,,
Calders,"Magma is stored beneath a volcano in a magma chamber. When a very large explosive eruption occurs which empties the magma chamber, the roof of the magma chamber can collapse forming a depression, or bowl on the surface which has very steep walls. These are calderas and can be tens of miles across.",,,
Eruption,"The release of hot magma, volcanic ash and/or gases from a volcano",,,
Explosive eruptions,"If a magma has a lot of gas which becomes trapped in the magma, the pressure will build and build until eventually the magma erupts explosively out of the volcano.",,,
Phreatomagmatic eruptions ,Phreatomagmatic eruptions are a type of explosive eruption that results from the magma erupting through water.,,,
Explosive,Explosive eruptions can form pyroclastic flows which sweep down valleys destroying everything in their path. They also send ash high into the atmosphere forming plumes.,,,
Effusive eruptions,"If a magma has low viscosity (it is runny), gas can escape easily, therefore, when the magma erupts at the surface, it forms lava flows. These eruptions are gentle effusive eruptions.",,,
Lava Dome,"If a magma rises very slowly within the conduit. or throat of the volcano, all the gas can escape. When the magma is viscous (or sticky), it can't flow when it reaches the surface, so it builds up forming a lava dome.",,,

Community,"A community can be defined as people living in one geographical area, who are exposed to common hazards due to their location. They may have common experience in responding to hazards and disasters. However, they may have different perceptions of and exposure to risk. Groups within the locality will have a stake in risk reduction measures (either in favour or against). D. W.McMillan and D. W. Chavis, (1986) defined community as “a feeling that members have of belonging, a feeling that members matter to one another and to the group, and a shared faith that members’ needs will be met through their commitment to be together”.",,,
Community Organisation,"Community based organizations are formal or informal groups organised at a local level, within a community, as close as possible to the individuals they serve. They provide services to people living in the community. The leaders of community based organizations are lay people, not doctors or government officials, although many have physicians as advisers and have a paid professional staff as well as volunteers. Funding usually comes from state governments, private donations, and local fund-raising events. They may or may not be registered.",,,

These actions are designed to put the community back together and include repairs to roads, bridges and other public facilities, restoration of power, water and other municipal services and other activities that help restore normal operations to a community",,,
Mitigation activities ,"reduce or eliminate the damages from hazardous events. These activities can occur before, during and after a disaster and overlap all phases of emergency management.  Mitigation also includes education programs for members of the public about the hazards to which their community is vulnerable, as well as the importance of mitigation and how to prepare their property to withstand a disaster.",,,
Structural mitigation,"Theses pertain to actions such as dam and levee projects to protect against flooding, constructing disaster-resistant structures, and retrofitting existing structures to withstand events. ",,,
Non-structural mitigation,"These activities development of land use plans, zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations and tax incentives and disincentives to discourage development in certain high-hazard areas.",,,
Preparedness activities,"involve at least two types of activities. Structural activities include actions to prepare for the imminent arrival of a hazard event, such as putting up storm shutters and sandbagging. Non-structural activities involve taking steps to minimize damage to personal property and to minimize harm to individuals. For instance, anchoring boats and storing outdoor furniture in sheds prior to the arrival of a hurricane will lessen the chance of damage to personal property. Following recommendations to evacuate an area will lessen the chance of harm to individuals. Preparedness activities include development of response procedures, design and installation of warning systems, exercises to test emergency operational procedures and training of emergency personnel",,,
Response activities ,"occur during or immediately following the disaster and include time-sensitive activities such as search and rescue operations, evacuation, emergency medical care, food and shelter programs. Response activities are designed to meet the urgent needs of disaster victims. ",,,
Recovery activities ,"are emergency management actions that begin after the disaster, as urgent needs are met. These actions are designed to put the community back together and include repairs to roads, bridges and other public facilities, restoration of power, water and other municipal services and other activities that help restore normal operations to a community.",,,
Vulnerability analysis ,indicates what is likely to be damaged by the identified hazards and how severely. The vulnerability analysis is an assessment of the number of lives and the value of the property in those areas that may be affected,,,
Capability analysis ,"is an important component of the hazard mitigation planning process because it identifies and evaluates existing systems of policies and practices that either reduce or increase a jurisdiction’s vulnerability to natural hazards. The capability analysis also provides critical information on which types of actions are feasible— in terms of financial resources, political willpower, institutional framework, technical ability and legal authority. Furthermore, the capability assessment can provide a mechanism to cite and take credit for those systems that already exist and are successful in the jurisdiction.",,,
Monitoring,"Monitoring is an important component of the implementation process. Care should be taken to monitor mitigation activities and their effects. It is important to be able to discern if the actions being taken are resulting in the desired objective of lessening the exposure to the hazard. Additionally, overall exposure to hazards needs to be continually monitored to ensure that while this exposure is being decreased in one location, it is not increasing in another. Periodic meetings of the planning committee or other group involved in the plan formulation process may be necessary to review progress to date and recommend changes to the mitigation program based on the results of their monitoring",,,
Evaluation,"No plan is perfect. As implementation proceeds, flaws will be discerned and changes will be needed. The effectiveness of the programs and actions should be evaluated to determine whether the goals and objectives articulated in the plan are still applicable. The original problem statement made in the introduction to the hazard mitigation plan should be assessed for current accuracy. Perhaps the situation has changed. The adequacy of available resources to carry out the plan should be examined. Is there any redundancy that can be eliminated, thereby freeing up funds from one area? Are funds for certain programs or projects inadequate; if so, should more funding be sought? The evaluation section should also trouble-shoot any problems being experienced with implementation, including technical, political, legal and coordination. Finally, the plan should be checked against its time frame— has it been implemented on schedule? Are all windows of opportunity being fully taken advantage of?",,,
Updates/Revisions,"The updating and revising step recognizes that hazard mitigation planning is a continuing process and provides an opportunity to measure and evaluate previous mitigation efforts. An updated or revised plan might include a re-evaluation of the hazards and the jurisdiction’s exposure to them, a further examination and refining of policies and issues, a reassessment of existing mitigation capabilities and new or additional mitigation recommendations ",,,
Multi-Hazard,"An “all-hazards” basis for a mitigation plan makes the most efficient use of limited resources The hazard mitigation plan should incorporate environmental principles. Care must be taken that policies intended to foster mitigation are not undertaken at the expense of the area’s environmental integrity. The plan should strictly adhere to all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances regarding the environment.",,,
Post-disaster Plans. ,"Governments have traditionally prepared stand-alone mitigation plans in the wake of a disaster, a practice that has the advantage of generating public support for mitigation while the obvious need for it is so readily apparent. Unfortunately, these post-disaster plans are often prepared without adequate background studies and under tremendous time pressures and may not adequately address mitigation issues outside the context of the immediate disaster. ",,,
Emergency Management Plan,"Some jurisdictions may include the hazard mitigation plan as a component of the emergency management plan. These plans deal with all four components of emergency management and include directions for the government’s responsibilities during preparation, response, recovery and mitigation phases. These plans tend to be programmatic in nature and focus on specific courses of action to be taken in the event of a disaster. Emergency management plans can also emphasize policy, however, and provide guidelines for implementing particular plan components",,,
Comprehensive Plan.,"Still other areas may decide to make the mitigation plan part of a comprehensive plan. Comprehensive plans tend to have a wider scope than stand-alone plans, setting general principles to guide future activity. This type of plan tends to be policy oriented, and deals with a whole range of issues, including land use, economic development, capital improvements, transportation, housing, natural resource protection and emergency management. Mitigation concepts can either be included in the comprehensive plan as a separate element or chapter or can be incorporated into the other plan components. This latter approach has the advantage of highlighting mitigation as a necessary component of all other government operations and calling for integration of mitigation into day-to-day decision making processes",,,
Natural Infrastructure,"As the connection between networks of streams, rivers, adjacent wetlands, soils, vegetation, dunes, beaches and other features of the natural environment are increasingly studied and understood, natural resource and environmental management are being recognized as vital for emergency management. This “natural infrastructure” can perform a mitigative function in the human environment, protecting lives and structures from the full impact of natural hazards by providing flood control, wind resistance, minimization of storm surge, etc. The hazard mitigation plan must promote efforts to enhance rather than hinder the mitigative ability of the natural environment before all such areas are developed and their mitigative value destroyed.",,,
