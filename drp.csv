When the rainfall becomes relatively scant or infrequent, it can disrupt the normal balance between the precipitation and the evaporation process and drought can begin. It can also be defined as a moisture deficiency that has serious, adverse effects on a community usually by reducing food production or surface water supplies."
Hydrological Drought,Hydrological Drought looks at the inadequacy of water by measuring stream flows and water levels in reservoirs and streams. Hydrological drought occurs out of phase with meteorological and agricultural drought because it takes longer for the deficiencies to show up in lakes and streams.
Agricultural Drought ,"Agricultural Drought examines the levels of moisture in plants while factoring in the elements such as sparse rainfall or low water supply levels. In areas experiencing drought, plant life is severely damaged"
Socio-Economic Drought,"Socio-Economic Drought, a new phenomenon, occurs where the demand for an economic good exceeds the supply because of a weather related shortfall in the water supply. An example of this phenomenon is the availability of rice, a Caribbean staple."

Landslide,"1-Geological phenomenon which includes a range of ground movement, such as rock falls, deep failure of slopes and shallow debris flows

2-A landslide is a mass movement of material, such as rock, earth or debris, down the slope of a hill or cliff. They can happen suddenly or move slowly over long periods of time. Landslides are classified by their type of movement. The four main types of movement are falls, topples, rotational slides, translational slides and flows. Landslides can be classified as just one of these movements or, more commonly, can be a mixture of several."
Flows,"Flows are landslides that involve the movement of material down a slope in the form of a fluid. When material on a slope becomes saturated with water, making it much heavier, it may develop into a debris flow or mud flow."
Debris Flow,"A debris flow is a moving mass of loose mud, sand, soil, rock, water and air that travels down a slope under the influence of gravity. To be considered a debris flow the moving material must be loose and capable of 'flow', and, at least 50% of the material must be sand-size particles or larger."
Mud Flow,A mud flow is composed of mud and water.
Falls,"Falls are landslides that involve the collapse of material from a cliff or steep slope. Falls usually involve a mixture of free fall through the air, bouncing or rolling. A fall type landslide results in the collection of rock or debris near the base of a slope."
Topples,"Topple failures involve the forward rotation and movement of a mass of rock, earth or debris out of a slope. This kind of slope failure generally occurs around an axis (or point) at or near the base of the block of rock"
Slides,"A slide type landslide is a down-slope movement of material that occurs along a distinctive surface of weakness such as a fault, joint or bedding plane."
Rotational Slide,If the slip surface is curved the slide said to be rotational. The slip surface of a rotational landslide tends to be deep. Blocks of failed material can rotate as they fail and can at times be seen to tilt backwards towards the slope.
Translational Slide,If the slip surface is straight then it is termed translational or planar. 
Submarine Landslide," The sea bed can fail when physical conditions change, just as on land, creating an underwater landslide. These mass movements of vast amounts of sediment are called submarine landslides or just slides"
Lightning strike,"An electrical discharge caused by lightning, typically during thunderstorms"
Limnic eruption,The sudden eruption of carbon dioxide from deep lake water

Tsunami,"A series of water waves caused by the displacement of a large volume of a body of water, typically an ocean or a large lake, usually caused by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, underwater explosions, landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts and other disturbances above or below water"
Stratovolcanoes,"Stratovolcanoes are majestic giants with steep sides and a symmetrical cone shape. They form from very thick, viscous, or sticky, lava that won't flow easily. The lava therefore builds up around the vent forming a volcano with steep sides – we call this a stratovolcano and it has a familar triangular shape"
Shield Volcano,"Where a volcano produces low viscosity, runny, lava it spreads far from the source forming a volcano with gentle slopes. This type is called a shield volcano."
Fissure Vent Eruption,"As magma rises, it will find the easiest route to reach the surface. If it rises up through a long fracture, fountains of lava can form a ‘curtain of fire’ which we call a fissure vent eruption"
Spatter Cone Volcano,"When magma contains too much gas to form an effusive lava flow, but too little to form an explosive eruption, it erupts from the volcano as blobs of magma which fall close to the vent forming a low, steep-sided cone that we call a spatter cone."
Calders,"Magma is stored beneath a volcano in a magma chamber. When a very large explosive eruption occurs which empties the magma chamber, the roof of the magma chamber can collapse forming a depression, or bowl on the surface which has very steep walls. These are calderas and can be tens of miles across."
Eruption,"The release of hot magma, volcanic ash and/or gases from a volcano"
Explosive eruptions,"If a magma has a lot of gas which becomes trapped in the magma, the pressure will build and build until eventually the magma erupts explosively out of the volcano."
Phreatomagmatic eruptions ,Phreatomagmatic eruptions are a type of explosive eruption that results from the magma erupting through water.
Explosive,Explosive eruptions can form pyroclastic flows which sweep down valleys destroying everything in their path. They also send ash high into the atmosphere forming plumes.
Effusive eruptions,"If a magma has low viscosity (it is runny), gas can escape easily, therefore, when the magma erupts at the surface, it forms lava flows. These eruptions are gentle effusive eruptions."
Lava Dome,"If a magma rises very slowly within the conduit. or throat of the volcano, all the gas can escape. When the magma is viscous (or sticky), it can't flow when it reaches the surface, so it builds up forming a lava dome."
Bioterrorism,The intentional release or dissemination of biological agents as a means of coercion
Civil unrest,"A disturbance caused by a group of people that may include sit-ins and other forms of obstructions, riots, sabotage and other forms of crime, and which is intended to be a demonstration to the public and the government, but can escalate into general chaos"

Tsunami,"A series of water waves caused by the displacement of a large volume of a body of water, typically an ocean or a large lake, usually caused by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, underwater explosions, landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts and other disturbances above or below water"
Community,"A community can be defined as people living in one geographical area, who are exposed to common hazards due to their location. They may have common experience in responding to hazards and disasters. However, they may have different perceptions of and exposure to risk. Groups within the locality will have a stake in risk reduction measures (either in favour or against). D. W.McMillan and D. W. Chavis, (1986) defined community as 'a feeling that members have of belonging, a feeling that members matter to one another and to the group, and a shared faith that members’ needs will be met through their commitment to be together'."
Community Organisation,"Community based organizations are formal or informal groups organised at a local level, within a community, as close as possible to the individuals they serve. They provide services to people living in the community. The leaders of community based organizations are lay people, not doctors or government officials, although many have physicians as advisers and have a paid professional staff as well as volunteers. Funding usually comes from state governments, private donations, and local fund-raising events. They may or may not be registered."
Evacuees,All persons removed or moving from areas threatened or struck by a disaster.
Evacuation:,"Organized, phased, and supervised dispersal of people from dangerous or potentially dangerous areas."
Spontaneous Evacuation,"· Spontaneous Evacuation. Residents or citizens in the threatened areas observe an emergency event or receive unofficial word of an actual or perceived threat and without receiving instructions to do so, elect to evacuate the area. Their movement means, and direction of travel is unorganized and unsupervised."
Voluntary Evacuation,"· Voluntary Evacuation. This is a warning to persons within a designated area that a threat to life and property exists or is likely to exist in the immediate future. Individuals issued this type of waning or order are NOT required to evacuate, however it would be to their advantage to do so."

Non-structural mitigations,"Any measure not involving physical construction that uses knowledge, practice or agreement to reduce risks and impacts, in particular through policies and laws, public awareness raising, training and education."
Public awareness:,"The processes of informing the general population, increasing levels of consciousness about risks and how people can act to reduce their exposure to hazards. This is particularly important for public officials in fulfilling their responsibilities to save lives and property in the event of a disaster. Public awareness activities foster changes in behaviour leading towards a culture of risk reduction. This involves public information, dissemination, education, radio or television broadcasts, use of printed media, as well as, the establishment of information centres and networks and community and participation actions."
Reconstruction,"refers to the full restoration of all services, and local infrastructure, replacement of damaged physical structures, the revitalization of economy and the restoration of social and cultural life."
Structural mitigation:,"Any physical construction to reduce or avoid possible impacts of hazards, or application of engineering techniques to achieve hazard-resistance and resilience in structures or systems."

Informing ,the development and dissemination of information which will enhance the capability of the individual or the private organisation to cope with or to get help when needed.
Recovery activities,"emergency management actions that begin after the disaster, as urgent needs are met. These actions are designed to put the community back together and include repairs to roads, bridges and other public facilities, restoration of power, water and other municipal services and other activities that help restore normal operations to a community"
Mitigation activities ,"reduce or eliminate the damages from hazardous events. These activities can occur before, during and after a disaster and overlap all phases of emergency management.  Mitigation also includes education programs for members of the public about the hazards to which their community is vulnerable, as well as the importance of mitigation and how to prepare their property to withstand a disaster."
Structural mitigation,"Theses pertain to actions such as dam and levee projects to protect against flooding, constructing disaster-resistant structures, and retrofitting existing structures to withstand events. "
Non-structural mitigation,"These activities development of land use plans, zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations and tax incentives and disincentives to discourage development in certain high-hazard areas."
Preparedness activities,"involve at least two types of activities. Structural activities include actions to prepare for the imminent arrival of a hazard event, such as putting up storm shutters and sandbagging. Non-structural activities involve taking steps to minimize damage to personal property and to minimize harm to individuals. For instance, anchoring boats and storing outdoor furniture in sheds prior to the arrival of a hurricane will lessen the chance of damage to personal property. Following recommendations to evacuate an area will lessen the chance of harm to individuals. Preparedness activities include development of response procedures, design and installation of warning systems, exercises to test emergency operational procedures and training of emergency personnel"
Response activities ,"occur during or immediately following the disaster and include time-sensitive activities such as search and rescue operations, evacuation, emergency medical care, food and shelter programs. Response activities are designed to meet the urgent needs of disaster victims. "
Recovery activities ,"are emergency management actions that begin after the disaster, as urgent needs are met. These actions are designed to put the community back together and include repairs to roads, bridges and other public facilities, restoration of power, water and other municipal services and other activities that help restore normal operations to a community."
Vulnerability analysis ,indicates what is likely to be damaged by the identified hazards and how severely. The vulnerability analysis is an assessment of the number of lives and the value of the property in those areas that may be affected
Capability analysis ,"is an important component of the hazard mitigation planning process because it identifies and evaluates existing systems of policies and practices that either reduce or increase a jurisdiction’s vulnerability to natural hazards. The capability analysis also provides critical information on which types of actions are feasible— in terms of financial resources, political willpower, institutional framework, technical ability and legal authority. Furthermore, the capability assessment can provide a mechanism to cite and take credit for those systems that already exist and are successful in the jurisdiction."
Monitoring,"Monitoring is an important component of the implementation process. Care should be taken to monitor mitigation activities and their effects. It is important to be able to discern if the actions being taken are resulting in the desired objective of lessening the exposure to the hazard. Additionally, overall exposure to hazards needs to be continually monitored to ensure that while this exposure is being decreased in one location, it is not increasing in another. Periodic meetings of the planning committee or other group involved in the plan formulation process may be necessary to review progress to date and recommend changes to the mitigation program based on the results of their monitoring"
Evaluation,"No plan is perfect. As implementation proceeds, flaws will be discerned and changes will be needed. The effectiveness of the programs and actions should be evaluated to determine whether the goals and objectives articulated in the plan are still applicable. The original problem statement made in the introduction to the hazard mitigation plan should be assessed for current accuracy. Perhaps the situation has changed. The adequacy of available resources to carry out the plan should be examined. Is there any redundancy that can be eliminated, thereby freeing up funds from one area? Are funds for certain programs or projects inadequate; if so, should more funding be sought? The evaluation section should also trouble-shoot any problems being experienced with implementation, including technical, political, legal and coordination. Finally, the plan should be checked against its time frame— has it been implemented on schedule? Are all windows of opportunity being fully taken advantage of?"
Updates/Revisions,"The updating and revising step recognizes that hazard mitigation planning is a continuing process and provides an opportunity to measure and evaluate previous mitigation efforts. An updated or revised plan might include a re-evaluation of the hazards and the jurisdiction’s exposure to them, a further examination and refining of policies and issues, a reassessment of existing mitigation capabilities and new or additional mitigation recommendations "
Multi-Hazard,"An 'all-hazards' basis for a mitigation plan makes the most efficient use of limited resources The hazard mitigation plan should incorporate environmental principles. Care must be taken that policies intended to foster mitigation are not undertaken at the expense of the area’s environmental integrity. The plan should strictly adhere to all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances regarding the environment."
Post-disaster Plans. ,"Governments have traditionally prepared stand-alone mitigation plans in the wake of a disaster, a practice that has the advantage of generating public support for mitigation while the obvious need for it is so readily apparent. Unfortunately, these post-disaster plans are often prepared without adequate background studies and under tremendous time pressures and may not adequately address mitigation issues outside the context of the immediate disaster. "
Emergency Management Plan,"Some jurisdictions may include the hazard mitigation plan as a component of the emergency management plan. These plans deal with all four components of emergency management and include directions for the government’s responsibilities during preparation, response, recovery and mitigation phases. These plans tend to be programmatic in nature and focus on specific courses of action to be taken in the event of a disaster. Emergency management plans can also emphasize policy, however, and provide guidelines for implementing particular plan components"
Comprehensive Plan.,"Still other areas may decide to make the mitigation plan part of a comprehensive plan. Comprehensive plans tend to have a wider scope than stand-alone plans, setting general principles to guide future activity. This type of plan tends to be policy oriented, and deals with a whole range of issues, including land use, economic development, capital improvements, transportation, housing, natural resource protection and emergency management. Mitigation concepts can either be included in the comprehensive plan as a separate element or chapter or can be incorporated into the other plan components. This latter approach has the advantage of highlighting mitigation as a necessary component of all other government operations and calling for integration of mitigation into day-to-day decision making processes"
Natural Infrastructure,"As the connection between networks of streams, rivers, adjacent wetlands, soils, vegetation, dunes, beaches and other features of the natural environment are increasingly studied and understood, natural resource and environmental management are being recognized as vital for emergency management. This 'natural infrastructure' can perform a mitigative function in the human environment, protecting lives and structures from the full impact of natural hazards by providing flood control, wind resistance, minimization of storm surge, etc. The hazard mitigation plan must promote efforts to enhance rather than hinder the mitigative ability of the natural environment before all such areas are developed and their mitigative value destroyed."
